"# Customer-Churn-Analysis---Telecom-Industry" 

Project Overview:

Customer churn is a significant issue in the telecom industry, where customers switch to competitors frequently. Understanding the factors leading to churn can help telecom companies devise strategies to retain customers and improve their services. This project involves:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting data types, and encoding categorical variables.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.

4. Model Development: Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict customer churn.

Dataset:

  The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains information about telecom customers, including their demographic details, account information, and usage patterns. Key features include:

    CustomerID
    Gender
    SeniorCitizen
    Partner
    Dependents
    Tenure
    PhoneService
    MultipleLines
    InternetService
    OnlineSecurity
    OnlineBackup
    DeviceProtection
    TechSupport
    StreamingTV
    StreamingMovies
    Contract
    PaperlessBilling
    PaymentMethod
    MonthlyCharges
    TotalCharges
    Churn

Data Preprocessing:

  1. Importing Libraries: Essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn are imported.

  2. Loading Data: The dataset is loaded and basic information is displayed to understand its structure.

  3. Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the 'TotalCharges' column are identified and handled.

  4. Removing Unwanted Columns: Columns like 'CustomerID' are dropped as they do not contribute to the analysis.

  5. Label Encoding: Categorical variables are encoded using LabelEncoder for model compatibility.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  Visualizations are created to explore the data and identify trends and patterns:

    Distribution of numerical features

    Count plots of categorical features

    Correlation heatmap to understand relationships between features

Feature Engineering:

  New features are created to enhance model performance. For instance, tenure groups are created based on the tenure of customers.

Model Development:

  Various machine learning models are developed and evaluated to predict customer churn. These include:

    1. Decision Tree
  
    2. Random Forest

    3. Gradient Boosting

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Results:

  The results section includes the performance of different models and insights gained from the analysis. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.

Conclusion:

  The project concludes with a summary of findings and potential strategies for reducing customer churn in the telecom industry. Future work may involve deploying the model in a real-world scenario and integrating it with    customer management systems.
